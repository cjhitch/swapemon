# Tech Stack

Fill out the headings below with your familiarly and comfort level with each piece of technology.


## Adobe XD

You are going to be using XD to create click-through designs of your application. It is recommended that you use an UI kit for a visual framework to help you design your applications as similarly to the potential live version as possible.

**How comfortable do you feel with XD?**
I understand it decently, although I prefer sketch.

**What are your concerns around using XD?**
I don't like that it doesn't come with any of the templating items. It gets annoying having to create a placeholder image. 

## React

You will be utilizing React as your front-end framework. You will be expected to use moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.

**How comfortable do you feel with React?**
I am very comfortable with React, it has been a daily use at work for some time now.

**What are your concerns around using React?**
In previous courses they taught us to use class based which is now a bit out of date and no longer encouraged for new projects. I tried "translating" over to functional with our last course, but had some difficulty with a couple of the items. I am minorly concerned about not being able to do that.

## Redux

Redux will be used to control your data and have proper data flow for your app. You will be expected to create well organized reducers, well built actions, and connected components.

**How comfortable do you feel with Redux?**
I have never used redux and don't recall learning it in any of our courses.

**What are your concerns around using Redux?**
Redux no longer feels necessary with the introduction of function React with hooks. The developer of Redux himself has even said as much.

## Node

You will be using Node as your server for both your API and to render your front-end. You will be required to use best practices, npm, and npx.

**How comfortable do you feel with Node?**
I am fairly comfortable with Node. It is another technology that I had used previous to school. School did a great job of helping me understand a better way to write clean code and use best practices.

**What are your concerns around using Node?**
I don't have much for concerns with Node. It is fairly straight forwards. It is basically just vanilla JS that renders server side.

## Express

You will be using express as your framework for your API. You will be using and building middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

**How comfortable do you feel with Express?**
I am moderately comfortable with Express. The ways we were taught in our previous class were slightly different than I have used previous, but similar concept.

**What are your concerns around using Express?**
I am a little slow at this. In our last class it seemed less like it was taught and more like they gave us code to copy. It took a while to understand what was going on, but I think I have a decent grasp on it now.

## SQL/Posgres/Sequelize

You will be utilizing a relational database with Sequelize as an ORM. You will be creating migrations, models, and seeds as well utilizing the models with full validated CRUD.

**How comfortable do you feel with Sequelize?**
As far as databases go, this one doesn't seem any different. I have a pretty good grasp on databases and setting up the CRUD aspect.

**What are your concerns around using Sequelize?**
I am not sure I understand what seeds are for a database. I also had a fair amount of issues using migration and models in the previous course. Even the stuff I did, the instructor was unable to find issues with the code I wrote. I am semi concerned about doing this from scratch due to the aformentioned comment about moreover copying code than actually feeling like we were being taught what to do.
